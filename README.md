# ðŸš— Overview
Car Service Manager is intended to be a specialised software that helps the mechanics and managers to monitor the workflow going through a car service shop. It's purporse is to keep track of the clients visiting it, the cars' service itself - what was it and when it was performed; who was the client, who was the car's mechanic.

There are two types of users that can access the data stored = Admin users (Managers and Main Mechanics) with larger data access and Users (employees) with less and more vague data exposure for them. The Admin profiles are predefined, while (new) User profiles can be added through the Register option available.
